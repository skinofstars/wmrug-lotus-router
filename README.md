# An introduction to Lotus::Router

Created as an introduction to the Lotus::Router gem, though also includes a basic
introduction to Rack.

This is intended to be viewed as a slide deck, but is written as a Rack application.

For notes see TALK.md

To run yourself, you just need to clone the repo and run `rackup`.
